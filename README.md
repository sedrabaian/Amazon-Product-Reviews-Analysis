ðŸ“¦ Amazon Product Reviews Analysis â€“ Cleaning & Insights ðŸ“Šâœ¨
Welcome to my first data science project! ðŸš€ In this project, I took a dive into Amazonâ€™s product review data â€” giving it a thorough cleaning, exploring customer behavior, and pulling out some key insights, all while sharpening my data skills.

The mission was simple: make sure the dataset is spotless, reliable, and ready for action. Even though the data came in looking pretty clean, I didnâ€™t take that for granted. I walked through all the essential cleaning steps â€” because in the real world, you always double-check! I verified there were no missing values or duplicates lurking in the data. Then, I made sure the data types were just right by converting the ratings from floats to integers (because who needs decimal points in star ratings, right?). I also transformed those long UNIX timestamps into readable date formats, making it easier to spot patterns over time.

Once the cleaning was done, the fun part began â€” exploration and visualization. I looked at how ratings were distributed to get a sense of customer satisfaction overall. Then, I zoomed in on the top five most reviewed products to highlight the crowd favorites. Itâ€™s amazing what simple visualizations can reveal about patterns in the data!

This project uses Python (my trusty sidekick), along with Pandas and NumPy for data wrangling, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for crisp visualizations. Everything was documented and run inside Jupyter Notebook, and the whole project is neatly version-controlled and shared here on GitHub.

But why stop here? Thereâ€™s plenty of room for future exploration! Some ideas on my radar include building a recommendation system based on the ratings data, performing sentiment analysis if product review texts are available, or analyzing trends over time to see how product popularity shifts.

Inside this repository, youâ€™ll find the full Jupyter Notebook containing all the cleaning steps, analysis, and visualizations. Optionally, Iâ€™ve also included the cleaned dataset as a CSV file, and any visualization images can be stored in a folder for reference.

Thanks for checking out my project â€” the dataâ€™s clean, the insights are sharp, and the possibilities are wide open!
